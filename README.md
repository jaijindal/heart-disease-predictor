# Welcome to Heart Diseases Predictor

## Walkthrough of the Repository  
This is a mini project for SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. This project aims to analyse all the factors affecting Heart Diseases and predict the probability of the user getting one.

1) The [Datasets Folder](Datasets/) contains the original BRFSS 2015 DATASET. Since its size is more than 500MB , it has been split into 3 zipfiles.
2) The [Presentation Folder](Presentation/) contains our PPT used to make our video.
3) The [Code Folder](Code/) contains the [Final Jupyter File](Code/DSAI_Project_Final.ipynb) that includes cleaning the dataset, data exploration, and ML Model. The [PKL File](Code/logReg_model.pkl) is the pickled ML Model extracted from the [Final Jupyter File](Code/DSAI_Project_Final.ipynb). The [Py Python File](Code/heart_predict_final.py) is used to program streamlit and use the ML Model in [PKL File](Code/logReg_model.pkl)  to predict probability of heart disease. If you wish to run the streamlit webapp in your own device, you will have to edit lines 22 and 215 of heart_predict_final.py to update the address of heart.jpg and logReg_Model.pkl.

## Problem Definition 

Identifying key health indicators that significantly affect heart diseases so that we can detect and prevent the factors having the greatest impact. 
1) What risk factors are most predictive of heart disease risk?
2) Can we use a subset of the risk factors to accurately build a webapp that can predict whether an individual has heart disease?

## Dataset

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.

## Cleaning the Dataset 
- The BRFSS Dataset initially had 441456 rows and 330 columns
- Shortlisted 22 columns most suited for heart diseases
- Dropped missing values. 97850 rows removed.
- Changing previously Ordinal variable to Categorical variable (Binary yes-no)
- Making ordering of Ordinal variable to become more precise by removing the unwanted statistical data
- Final 21 variables listed as Blood pressure, cholesterol, how recent is cholesterol check, BMI, smoke activity, stroke, diabetes, physical activity frequency, eat fruits, eat veggies, amount of alcohol consumption, registered healthcare insurance, financial problems for medical visits, general health, mental health, physical health, difficulty walking/climbing stairs, sex, age, education level, income level.

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
- From the data exploration of heart disease or attack value the percentages were derived and the ratio of no heart disease to the possibility is 9:1
- The average of heart disease of those with diabetes (category 2) is higher than those with pre-diabetes(category 1) which is double the value of those with no diabetes (category 0)
- The average of heart disease and diabetes for those who have high blood cholesterol is seen to be high. 
- An increase those with heart diseased can be spotted in the higher age categories. In the Age categories 9 to 13 even though the total number is declining those with a heart diseased is increasing.
- The correlation matrix extremely useful for producing data-driven insights that are mentioned below.


## Machine Learning Model
- Decided to use logistics regression after extensive research and consideration for other machine learning models
- Extracted response and predictors. Assigned Y as dependent variable (HeartDiseaseorAttack) and X as 21 independent variables dataframe
- Split dataset into random train and test with ratio of 0.25
- Imported modules such as preprocessing and pipeline from sklearn to scale the model
- Ran the model and dumped it into a PKL file using joblib. 
- Used spyder to create streamlit application where we use the ML Model (PKL file) to predict heart disease risk.

- The accuracy of the model came out to be around 89% which shows our model is not only ideal but also realistic.
- The model showed 1.4% false positives.


## Application In Real Life

Using our ML Function through our Streamlit interface, users can:

1) Check for risk of heart diseases based on lifestyle practices
2) Look for recommendations to improve their overall health 
3) Understand the major factors affecting their health and consult their doctors before it is too late.


## Data Driven Insights
Increase risk of Heart Diseases if:

1) High Cholesterol levels
2) High Blood Pressure 
3) Smoked more than 100 cigarettes in your life
4) Older age
5) Worsening Physical Health and Mental Health
6) No Physical Exercise

Factors such as number of fruits and vegetables eaten in a day, health insurance , and medical cost did not significantly affect the risk of heart diseases as compared to independent variables mentioned above . 


## What did we learn from this project?

1) Use of Streamlit for deploying webapp and incorporating a beautiful interface for our ML model pickled using joblib
2) Use of methods such as predict and predict_proba in logistic regression
3) Exploring Sklearn modules such as Pipeline , Standard scaler for scaling and further exploration of seaborn as a tool for visualization
4) Collaborating using GitHub
5) Cleaning and Curating datasets and binary and multiclass classification
