# Welcome to Heart Diseases Predictor

## Walkthrough of the Repository  
###### This is a mini project for SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. This project aims to analyse all the factors affecting Heart Diseases and predict the probability of the user getting one.

###### 1)The Datasets folder contains the original BRFSS 2015 DATASET. Since its size is more than 500MB , it has been split into 3 zipfiles
###### 2)The Presentation folder contains our PPT used to make our video.
###### 3)The Code folder contains the final ipynb file that includes cleaning the dataset, data exploration, and ML Model. The PKL file is the pickled ML Model extracted from the ipynb file. The py file is used to program streamlit and use the ML Model in pkl file to predict probability of heart disease. If you wish to run the streamlit webapp in your own device, you will have to edit lines 22 and 215 to update the address of heart.jpg and logReg_Model.pkl.
